# ConkyScript
My conky desktop system monitor, in certain respects, was started as a badge of geek honor. However, as I started to hone the script, I found a real utilitarian purpose for the script. For example, changing the colors of Total CPU, CPU Temperature, and RAM when a certain threshold level is met.  

### To Do  
1. Have the CONNECTIONS section flash a warning if my computer is being connected to via ssh or telnet.
