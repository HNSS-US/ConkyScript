# ConkyScript
My conky desktop system monitor, in certain respects, was started as a badget of geek honor. However, as I started to hone the script, I found a real utilitarian purpose for it. The next planned enhancement is to have the CONNECTIONS section flash a warning if my computer is being connected to via ssh or telnet.
